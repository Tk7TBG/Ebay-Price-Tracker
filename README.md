# eBay Price Tracker

This project is an **eBay Price Tracker** built in Python. The script scrapes **historical** eBay listings for specific products and prices. The tool helps track historical prices for auctions and "Buy It Now" listings to help you make a more informed decision based on price trends.

# Future Improvements
Use statistics to filter out extreme outliers to make data more true

Data Export: Save the scraped data to a CSV file for further analysis.

Error Handling: Add robust error handling for missing fields or invalid URLs.

Dynamic URL Input: Allow users to input their own eBay search URLs dynamically.

Graphical Analysis: Integrate data visualization to analyze pricing trends.
